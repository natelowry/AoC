// --- Day 11: Space Police ---
// On the way to Jupiter, you're pulled over by the Space Police.

// "Attention, unmarked spacecraft! You are in violation of Space Law! All spacecraft must have a clearly visible registration identifier! You have 24 hours to comply or be sent to Space Jail!"

// Not wanting to be sent to Space Jail, you radio back to the Elves on Earth for help. 
// Although it takes almost three hours for their reply signal to reach you, they send instructions for how to power up the emergency hull painting robot 
// and even provide a small Intcode program (your puzzle input) that will cause it to paint your ship appropriately.

// There's just one problem: you don't have an emergency hull painting robot.

// You'll need to build a new emergency hull painting robot. 
// The robot needs to be able to move around on the grid of square panels on the side of your ship, detect the color of its current panel, 
// and paint its current panel black or white. (All of the panels are currently black.)

// The Intcode program will serve as the brain of the robot. 
// The program uses input instructions to access the robot's camera: provide 0 if the robot is over a black panel or 1 if the robot is over a white panel.
// Then, the program will output two values:

// First, it will output a value indicating the color to paint the panel the robot is over: 0 means to paint the panel black, and 1 means to paint the panel white.
// Second, it will output a value indicating the direction the robot should turn: 0 means it should turn left 90 degrees, and 1 means it should turn right 90 degrees.
// After the robot turns, it should always move forward exactly one panel. The robot starts facing up.

// The robot will continue running for a while like this and halt when it is finished drawing. Do not restart the Intcode computer inside the robot during this process.

// For example, suppose the robot is about to start running. Drawing black panels as ., white panels as #, and the robot pointing the direction it is facing (< ^ > v), the initial state and region near the robot looks like this:

// .....
// .....
// ..^..
// .....
// .....
// The panel under the robot (not visible here because a ^ is shown instead) is also black, and so any input instructions at this point should be provided 0. Suppose the robot eventually outputs 1 (paint white) and then 0 (turn left). After taking these actions and moving forward one panel, the region now looks like this:

// .....
// .....
// .<#..
// .....
// .....
// Input instructions should still be provided 0. Next, the robot might output 0 (paint black) and then 0 (turn left):

// .....
// .....
// ..#..
// .v...
// .....
// After more outputs (1,0, 1,0):

// .....
// .....
// ..^..
// .##..
// .....
// The robot is now back where it started, but because it is now on a white panel, input instructions should be provided 1. After several more outputs (0,1, 1,0, 1,0), the area looks like this:

// .....
// ..<#.
// ...#.
// .##..
// .....
// Before you deploy the robot, you should probably have an estimate of the area it will cover: specifically, you need to know the number of panels it paints at least once, regardless of color. In the example above, the robot painted 6 panels at least once. (It painted its starting panel twice, but that panel is still only counted once; it also never painted the panel it ended on.)

// Build a new emergency hull painting robot and run the Intcode program on it. How many panels does it paint at least once?

// To begin, get your puzzle input.
